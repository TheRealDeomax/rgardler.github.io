title: The Community Development App
tags: [docker, node]

I'm embarking on building a new application to experiment with Docker, micro-services and continuous integration and deployment on Azure. Like most of my posts here my goal is to document my learnings. So here we are at the starting point: creating a Node.js Hello World application.

# The Goal State 

I do a great deal of open source work. Since I'm not the most talented developer around my focus tends to be on facilitating healthy communities so that others can write better code. To that end the application I'm going to build will help with identifying community activities relating to selected topics.

The application will, eventually, pull data from places like meetups.com and allow later processing and dissemination of the information within appropriate channels.
