A Jekyll powered blog. Modtly thid content is for my own records, just in case I need to come back to it in the future. Others might find some posts useful. It's more likely that someone would want to pick up my Jekyll and Bootstrap confguration.

I welcome contributions to both content and configuration, though in reality I dont's expect to see any.
