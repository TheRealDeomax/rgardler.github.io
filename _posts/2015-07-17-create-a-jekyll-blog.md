title: Creating a Jekyll Blog
---

I've not been blogging for a numnber of years, and I've never had a
personal blog that lasted. Maybe now is the time to change that. My
goal is not to use this blog to create high quality content, this is a
place for me to keep notes, mostly for myself to come back to, but
maybe others will find it useful.
