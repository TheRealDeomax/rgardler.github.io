title: Schedule Jekyll Posts for Publication
tags: [jekyll]

Since posts on this Jekyll powered blog are short and very much task
focussed they tend to come in fits and starts. Here's how to stagger
their publication.

## Control the future ##

The '''_drafts''' folder is a great place for work in progress, but
you still need to manually move content from here into the
'''_posts''' folder when complete. What we really need is a way to
control publication date. Fortunately Jekyll provides a way to do
this.

#### FIXME: Does this work with Github pages though? ####

Open up your '''_config.yml''' file and add '''future: false'''. Now
whenever you write a post with a filename that has a date in the
future it will not be generated by Jekyll.
