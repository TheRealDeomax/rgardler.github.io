title: Schedule Jekyll Posts for Publication

Since posts on this Jekyll powered blog are short and very much task
focussed they tend to come in fits and starts. Here's how to stagger
their publication.

## Control the future ##

The '''_drafts''' folder is a great place for work in progress, but
you still need to manually move content from here into the
'''_posts''' folder when complete. What we really need is a way to
control publication date. Fortunately Jekyll provides a way to do
this.

Open up your '''_config.yml''' file and add '''future: false'''. Now
whenever you write a post with a filename that has a date in the
future it will not be generated by Jekyll.

Note, however, that if you are running the Jekyll server with the
--drafts switch you will still see future posts in your archives
list. Keep an eye on their publication dates.

## Open Questions ##

  * When the site is published to GitHub pages will the future pages
    be published automatically?
